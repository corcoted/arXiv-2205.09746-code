"Beyond the ABCDs: A projective geometry treatment of paraxial ray tracing using homogeneous coordinates"
Theodore A. Corcovilos (c) 2023, *American Journal of Physics 91*(6):449-457. [doi:10.1119/5.0083069](http://doi.org/10.1119/5.0083069) and also available at [arXiv:2205.09746](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.09746).

All of the examples in the manuscript are worked here in [python](http://python.org) using the symbolic algebra library [_sympy_](http://www.sympy.org/).  The end section contains additional examples that were omitted from the final version of the paper.

This python script is a [Jupyter notebook](http://jupyter.org/) in the "percent" archival notebook format, but it is best viewed by first converting into the Jupyter notebook standard format using [`jupytext`](https://jupytext.readthedocs.io).
